The Azure SDK for Python is a set of libraries which allow you to work on Azure for your management, runtime or data needs.

For a more general view of Azure and Python, you can go on the `Python Developer Center for Azure <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/python/>`_


Installation
------------

You can install individually each library for each Azure service:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install azure-batch          # Install the latest Batch runtime library
   $ pip install azure-mgmt-scheduler # Install the latest Storage management library

Preview packages can be installed using the ``--pre`` flag:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install --pre azure-mgmt-compute # will install only the latest Compute Management library
