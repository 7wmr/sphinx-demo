Azure Repos
=======================

.. topic:: Summary

    Azure Repos is a set of version control tools that you can use to manage your code. 
    Whether your software project is large or small, using version control as soon as 
    possible is a good idea.

    Version control systems are software that help you track changes you make in your 
    code over time. As you edit your code, you tell the version control system to take 
    a snapshot of your files. The version control system saves that snapshot permanently 
    so you can recall it later if you need it. Use version control to save your work and 
    coordinate code changes across your team.

    Even if you're just a single developer, version control helps you stay organized as 
    you fix bugs and develop new features. Version control keeps a history of your 
    development so that you can review and even roll back to any version of your code 
    with ease.
