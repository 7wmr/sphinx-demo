Azure Pipelines
=======================

.. topic:: Summary

    Azure Pipelines is a cloud service that you can use to automatically build and test 
    your code project and make it available to other users. It works with just about 
    any language or project type. 
    
    Azure Pipelines combines continuous integration (CI) 
    and continuous delivery (CD) to constantly and consistently test and build your code 
    and ship it to any target.
